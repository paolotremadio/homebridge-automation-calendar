# Automation - Calendar

Example config.json:

```
    "accessories": [
        {
            "accessory": "AutomationCalendar",
            "name": "Test",
            "latitude": 51.4825747,
            "longitude": -0.0251685
        }  
    ]

```

This accessory will create a fake sensor with some custom characteristics.
Use one or more characteristic to limit the automation to a specific period of time (e.g. only during the winter or only during the day).

## Configuration

* `latitude` your home latitude (used for astronomical calculations); e.g. *-33.8567844*
* `longitude` your home longitude (used for astronomical calculations); e.g. *151.2152967*
